Step 1: Download the Zip File from the Web or Ilearn

Step 2: Unzip the File
Once the download is complete, find the zip file in your downloads folder. Right-click the file and select “Extract All” (or use your preferred extraction tool) to unzip the contents into a designated folder.

Step 3: Launch Visual Studio Code
Open Visual Studio Code on your computer. If you don't have it installed, download it from the official website and follow the installation instructions.

Step 4: Open the folder in VSCode 
You can do this by clicking File> Open Folder> Downloads> the unzipped version of the folder>Select Folder

Step 5: Access the .SRC Code Directory
Once the folder is open in Visual Studio Code, look for the directory labeled ".SRC Code." Click on it to reveal a dropdown list of files contained within.

Step 6: Locate and Open App.java
In the list of files, scroll through until you find App.java. Click on it to open the file in the editor.

Step 7: Configure Your Java Environment (if necessary)
Before running the code, ensure that your Java Development Kit (JDK) is properly installed. If you haven't set up your environment, download the JDK from the official Oracle website or adopt OpenJDK, and follow the setup instructions.

Step 8: Run App.java
To run the code, you can either:
- Click the triangle play button in the top right corner of the editor, or
Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code (by selecting “Terminal” > “New Terminal” from the menu) and type "java App.java" (without quotes), and then hit Enter.
